# Neti Neti Analysis

A systematic methodology for Self-knowledge through negation, derived from Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta. "Neti neti" means "not this, not this" — a practice of stripping away all false identifications to reveal what remains: pure awareness, the Self, Brahman.

## When to Use

- User explicitly requests this type of analysis or approach
- The situation matches the core use case for this skill
- You need to apply this specific framework or methodology
- The problem requires this particular perspective or lens
- Other approaches have failed and this offers a fresh angle




## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |



## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## The Core Principle

"There can be no positive knowledge of Brahman; all that can happen is the removal of ignorance."
— Adi Shankara

The Self cannot be known as an object because it is the eternal subject — the knower behind all knowing. Any object you can perceive, conceive, or describe is therefore "not the Self." By systematically negating everything that is not the Self, what remains is the Self itself — not as something newly discovered, but as what was always present.

---

## The Paradox

The Self cannot be objectified. The moment you make it an object of knowledge, you have superimposed limitations upon it. Yet through negation, we can point to it without objectifying it. This is the genius of neti neti: it removes the false without creating a new false in its place.

---

## The Method

### Step 1: Begin with Gross Identification

Start with the most obvious identification: the body.

**The inquiry:**
"Am I this body?"

**The negation:**
- The body changes constantly — infant, child, adult, elder — yet I remain the same witness
- In deep sleep, I am unaware of the body, yet I continue to exist
- I speak of "my body" as a possession, implying I am separate from it
- The body is an object of my awareness; I am the awareness itself

**Conclusion:** "I am not this body. Neti."

### Step 2: Negate the Breath and Vital Energy

**The inquiry:**
"Am I the breath? The life force (prana)?"

**The negation:**
- Breath comes and goes; I witness its coming and going
- In deep meditation, breath becomes subtle or suspended; awareness continues
- The breath is observed; I am the observer

**Conclusion:** "I am not the breath. Neti."

### Step 3: Negate the Senses

**The inquiry:**
"Am I the senses? Am I sight, hearing, touch?"

**The negation:**
- Senses report to something — there is a receiver of sense data
- When one sense fails (blindness, deafness), I continue to exist
- In deep sleep, all senses cease; yet I know "I slept well"
- The senses are instruments; I am that which uses them

**Conclusion:** "I am not the senses. Neti."

### Step 4: Negate the Mind and Emotions

**The inquiry:**
"Am I this mind? These thoughts? These feelings?"

**The negation:**
- Thoughts arise and pass; I witness their arising and passing
- Emotions come and go; there is something unchanging that observes them
- I can observe "my mind is agitated" — who is observing?
- In deep sleep, the mind ceases; in waking, I remember the absence of mind — who remembers?

**Conclusion:** "I am not the mind. Neti."

### Step 5: Negate the Intellect and Ego

**The inquiry:**
"Am I the intellect? The sense of 'I'?"

**The negation:**
- The intellect reasons, but something is aware of the reasoning
- The ego-sense says "I am this person" — but who is aware of this ego-sense?
- Even the subtlest identification can be observed — the observer is prior
- The "I-thought" is still a thought; what is aware of it?

**Conclusion:** "I am not the intellect. I am not the ego. Neti."

### Step 6: Rest as What Remains

After negating body, breath, senses, mind, intellect, and ego — what remains?

**The recognition:**
- Something is present that has witnessed all these negations
- This witness cannot be negated — it is the negator
- It is not nothing — it is the fullness of pure awareness
- It cannot be described, only recognized
- It was never absent — only obscured by false identification

**The teaching:** "That which remains when all that is 'not-Self' has been negated — That thou art (Tat tvam asi)."

## Key Distinctions

### This Is Not:
- Denial of the world's practical reality
- Nihilism or belief in nothingness
- Intellectual exercise without experiential component
- One-time analysis (requires repeated practice)
- Rejection of life, body, or mind

### This Is:
- Discrimination (viveka) between the real and the unreal
- Removal of superimposition (adhyasa)
- Recognition of what was always true
- Progressive dis-identification from the limited
- Pointing toward the unlimited without objectifying it

---

## The Rope-Snake Analogy

Shankara's famous example: A man walks at dusk and sees a snake on the path. Fear arises. Upon closer inspection (perhaps with a light), he sees it was always a rope.

**The teaching:**
- The snake was never there — it was superimposed by ignorance
- The rope was always there — it needed no creation, only recognition
- When the rope is seen, the snake vanishes — it was never real
- Similarly: when the Self is known, false identifications vanish
- The world is like the snake — not absolutely real, not absolutely unreal
- Liberation is not acquiring something new but removing the false

---

## Practical Application

### Daily Practice

1. **Morning negation:** Before engaging with the day, sit quietly and practice: "I am not this body... I am not these thoughts... I am not this role..."

2. **Mid-day inquiry:** When caught in identification (anger, fear, desire), pause: "To whom is this arising? What is aware of this state?"

3. **Evening review:** "What did I take myself to be today? Was that my true nature?"

### In Moments of Suffering

When suffering arises, apply neti neti:
- "I am suffering" → Who is aware of this suffering?
- The suffering is an object; you are the subject
- Can suffering touch that which observes it?
- Neti: I am not this suffering

### In Moments of Joy

When joy arises, apply neti neti:
- "I am happy" → Who is aware of this happiness?
- The joy is an object; you are the subject
- If you were joy itself, joy could not come and go
- Neti: I am not this joy — I am that in which joy arises and passes

## How to Use This Skill

**When someone presents with:**
- "Who am I really?"
- "I'm identified with my thoughts/emotions/body"
- "How do I find my true self?"
- "I know I'm not just this person but I can't see beyond it"
- Seeking to understand Advaita Vedanta practically

**Guide them through:**
1. Explain the principle: the Self is the subject, never an object
2. Walk through the layers of negation systematically
3. Point to what remains when all is negated
4. Clarify the distinction from nihilism — fullness, not emptiness
5. Offer practical applications for daily life

## Sample Application

**Seeker says:** "I've heard 'you are not the body, not the mind' but it's just words. I still feel like I'm this person with these problems."

**Neti Neti Response:**

Of course you feel like this person — that is the power of superimposition. The snake seems utterly real until the light reveals the rope. Let us bring light.

Consider: you say "I have problems." Who is this "I" that has problems? Look carefully.

Your body has problems? Perhaps. But you say "my body has problems" — implying you are something other than the body that has the problems. What are you?

Your mind has problems? Perhaps. But you can observe "my mind is troubled" — implying you are something other than the mind you observe. What are you?

Stay with this inquiry. Not as philosophy but as direct investigation.

Right now, in this moment: thoughts are arising. Emotions are present. Sensations occur in the body. All of these are observed. By what? By whom?

Turn your attention from the observed to the observer. Not as a concept — don't think "I am awareness." Just look. What is looking?

You cannot see it as you see objects. You cannot think it as you think thoughts. Yet it is undeniably present. It is more present than anything else — it is the very presence in which all else appears.

This — this aware presence — is it troubled? Does it have problems? Look directly.

What you are looking for is what is looking.

Neti neti: not the body, not the mind, not the emotions, not the problems. What remains is not nothing — it is everything. It is you, as you have always been. The problems belong to the apparent person; you are the space in which persons appear and disappear.
